### Hi there 👋

<!--
**HUANGZiyin1/HUANGZiyin1** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

-->SC sequences were gathered from other sources [1], [2], or self-capture to form our dataset, “PolyUSCC”.
Thirty-four HEVC standard video sequences of various resolutions (1920×1080, 1680×1050, 1280×720) are adopted.
These sequences can be divided into three types: text and graphics with motion (TGM), animation (A), and mixed (M) content.
The dataset consists of three parts:
First, to guarantee data reliability and availability, half of the dataset (15 sequences) are provided from the JCT-VC [1].
Second, there are 5 SC sequences from Tsang et al. [2].
To enrich the text and graphics with motion content and mixed content sequences, we further capture 14 video sequences by ourselves.
