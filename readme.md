# *SCREEN CONTENT DATASET* 

## 0. Introduction

- SC sequences were gathered from other sources [1], [2], or self-capture from our dataset, “PolyUSCC”.
- Thirty-four HEVC standard video sequences of various resolutions (1920×1080, 1680×1050, 1280×720) are adopted.These sequences can be divided into three types: text and graphics with motion (TGM), animation (A), and mixed (M) content.
- The dataset consists of three parts:
  - First, to guarantee data reliability and availability, half of the dataset (15 sequences) are provided from the JCT-VC [1] but not included in CTC [3].
  - Second, there are 5 SC sequences from Tsang et al. [2].
  - To enrich the text and graphics with motion content and mixed content sequences, we further capture 14 video sequences by ourselves.
